    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now i have to proceed my life to another stage. thats my higher studies. i had no idea till this semester. then finally thought of proceeding in CAT ( even its tougher and herculian task to accomplish). I have my friend too there thats the only hope i have. Then a dull and lazy semseter i have ever faced is this one.  I have to increase my english as well as mathematical ( i lack here) skill . I think i will do my best atleast for the sake of my parents (as did in  hopeless lazy schooling ). Going to TIME at sundays as a part of coaching ( even I know they are not more than money grabbers ).  I  think of  changing  every thing in this world But Im a speck here  oscillating in winds direction chaotically .</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>if You are a beginner in linux then read this : www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html
I think it provides enough info about lampp</p>

<p>Test your lampp by  moving http://localhost:[port]/
then do this  create a account in dyndns : https://www.dyndns.com/
then configure your router to forward the url to appropriate dns say 192.168.1.1 for bsnl
then open your apache's httpd.conf and change server name to dyndns host name
if needed change port number to avoid google bots
you are done with now check out your workstation in friends home and have a cheers!!!! :-)</p>
