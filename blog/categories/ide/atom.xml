    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>How it started</h2>

<p>I started my coding in a windows machine with notepad.
Then I came through a term called IDE which has everything a programmer
needs in one place ( except beer ). Starting with netbeans for java
and some random Junit test tools in eclipse , I really regreted for
wasting my time in notepad. Usually I wasted my time in
* Searching the API sheet for exact name of method
  * In Java typically confused with length() , size() , count or length variable usage
  * I know rubyists , ruby has everything
* Missing ( , { or some parantheses ( not as much careless as initial days  )
  * I remember my first programming lab on c which I spent most of my time in figuring out the matching parantheses for the code I copied from internet
* Variable declared with one name but using it with different name</p>

<pre><code>* I used to decalre a variable with User#name  and trying to access with User#username 
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Version control integration

<ul>
<li>Version control itself is a different topic to discuss for hours</li>
<li>I use some set of plugins to commit and revert ( which I don't even bother on what command it is being translated on in background )</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
