    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>How it started</h2>

<p>I started my coding in a windows XP with notepad.
I can realize now how terrible it was.
Then I came through a term called IDE which has everything a programmer
needs in one place. Starting with netbeans for java
and some random Junit test tools in eclipse , I really regreted for
wasting my time in notepad.</p>

<p>Most of the times I used to do one among these listed items apart from real typing/coding:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Searching the API sheet for exact name of method</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java typically confused with length() , size() , count or length variable usage</li>
<li>I know rubyists , ruby has everything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Missing ( , { or some parantheses ( not as much careless as initial days  )</p>

<ul>
<li>I remember my first programming lab on c which I spent most of my time in figuring out the matching parantheses for the code I copied from internet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Variable declared with one name but using it with different name</p>

<ul>
<li>I used to decalre a variable with User#name  and trying to access with User#username</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Version control integration</p>

<ul>
<li>Version control itself is a different topic to discuss for hours</li>
<li>I use some set of plugins to commit and revert ( which I don't even bother on what command it is being translated on in background )</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
