    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>well this morning I received a flash embedded scrap from my friend and I'm really afraid and searched for web cam's all around and even tried after disconnecting from net  what a shit  worked too :(</p>

<p>Now take a try of this application as many times as possible till you find it fails , and  let they accept you cheated it ...</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.orkut-scrapping.com/img/special/mindreader.swf">Mind reader</a></strong>( remember its a flash application )</p>

<p>Now come back here .. Guess you must anxious and afraid how it works exactly as your mind thinks it   ( the same situation where I'm few hours before )</p>

<p>I tried it as many times as possible  , this happened unless my browser crashed and till I'm satisfied that it's not a trial and error</p>

<p> I thought in different angle as I can ,  whether they trace thro' webcam , with my angle of inclination of head ,etc etc,.</p>

<p>Then I really thought how stupid I'm when i keenly watched the application for several times .</p>

<p>well guess you tried it before and now what makes a application less than 100 kb to guess what your mind reads</p>

<p><strong>
A simple logic now keenly watch all the logos in multiples of 9 ..( Thats what you are going to get   :P)</strong></p>

<p>and try now you got the thing ( if you didn't know its logic so far ) and see how many pale faces are still waiting to be cheated :D</p>
