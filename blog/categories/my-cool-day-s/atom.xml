    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>well this morning I received a flash embedded scrap from my friend and I'm really afraid and searched for web cam's all around and even tried after disconnecting from net  what a shit  worked too :(</p>

<p>Now take a try of this application as many times as possible till you find it fails , and  let they accept you cheated it ...</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.orkut-scrapping.com/img/special/mindreader.swf">Mind reader</a></strong>( remember its a flash application )</p>

<p>Now come back here .. Guess you must anxious and afraid how it works exactly as your mind thinks it   ( the same situation where I'm few hours before )</p>

<p>I tried it as many times as possible  , this happened unless my browser crashed and till I'm satisfied that it's not a trial and error</p>

<p> I thought in different angle as I can ,  whether they trace thro' webcam , with my angle of inclination of head ,etc etc,.</p>

<p>Then I really thought how stupid I'm when i keenly watched the application for several times .</p>

<p>well guess you tried it before and now what makes a application less than 100 kb to guess what your mind reads</p>

<p><strong>
A simple logic now keenly watch all the logos in multiples of 9 ..( Thats what you are going to get   :P)</strong></p>

<p>and try now you got the thing ( if you didn't know its logic so far ) and see how many pale faces are still waiting to be cheated :D</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.tsiba.org.za/uploads/images/give_5_logo_op_2.jpg" alt="5 Th sem :(" /></p>

<p>Semester five .. well a suckiest sem I have ever seen  .</p>

<p> well every time I speak I used to say the latter is the worst . But now  situation seems more and more bad :) . Writing exams for filling up 3 hours and not even bothering about labs . But actually that's  the sem i thought to do lots and more :P .</p>

<p>successfully completed my semester examinations at worser than worse. That doesn't even matter for me . Thought of enjoying a full month leave .Nothing gonna help me releaving from this boring holidays ( I tried everything I can ) .  But happiest one is Sem V is no more . I have passed by one of the 8 . ( Not sure about results )</p>

<p>But this semester made a huge list of remarkable things and actually I feel the semester I have enjoyed a lot relatively . Proximity knows about that :P. Let it B.</p>

<p>Thought of doing some useful things in this holidays .Let me see what awaits ;) .</p>
