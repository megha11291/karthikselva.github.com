<p>I have to start with saying Cameroon dissaponted me ...</p>

<p>Even storyline doesnt seems to be great but   visual effects are fantastic and real . Na'vi's are the creatures in a planet pandora . For me their appearance resembles as traditional character Lord  Rama  . Avatar too is sanskrit word meaning phases of vishnu where one is Rama . I guess it may be a copy :P  .</p>

<p>No great explanation about the planets existence whats their origin where is it actually located .. blah blah  . The most humorous thing I  noticed is the base attack with lumps of fire ( where the place  people struggle for oxygen ,  but how combustion is possible  :P  ) .</p>

<p>I don't know where to categorize this film .. either in animation or  comic series or scientific fiction or just an entertainer .. Only plus point makes the film still run is 3D . the existence of evya the holy god still confuses me whether film falls under spiritual r religious category :D .</p>

<p>The soul DNA transformation concept , electrochemical network of trees , the precious stones significance and  the hair like generic  interface between avatar and rest living creatures  could  be explained little more.</p>

<p>Its seems like Cameroon loosing his originality and resembles Speilsburg 's Jurassic park. A must watch  film for kids &lt; 10 :D .</p>

<p>Well if you fix on to watch this movie I recommend you  to watch it in 3D with surround sound ( don't watch it out in your damn old pc and get disappointed )</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://images.starpulse.com/Photos/Previews/Benjamin-Button-movie-28.jpg" alt="preview" /></p>

<p>Life is a symmetrical . We have a growing phase ,stabilize at same point then shrinking phase when we turn older and feeble.Vice versa is the story line .Even it seems more paradoxical and no supportive scientific ideas have been supported this movie seems great.</p>

<p>Movie seems a bit slow but steady in its flow of scenes .starting with Daisy the story rolls on towards so many interesting personality ( Quinnie  is my favorite of all , a motherly goddess) . I dono why clock maker gateau interrupts the story . Short and tragic about him . Then story captures it real pace , Thomas button abandons his child . Why the baby was so ugly and what made him so was not clearly explained ( since its not a fiction film :P )  .</p>

<p>Quinine takes the baby and grows it irrespective all the obstacle she faces from her man and doctor ... why he cries like normal  baby when stamped by Tizzy under stairs rather feeble voice of a old man  . Every one miracles about survival of this man . If they wanna tell really about reversal of phases why Benjamin plays with spoon and wanna play like rest children :P  ( as in first phase of benjamin) .</p>

<p>Then starts working with tug boat and knows part of life.And enjoys everything he can  . I guess the only girl left around entire film is Caroline :P. As the film has two perspective views from Daisy side and Benjamin side,makes viewers more interesting and careful to watch  in every scenes.</p>

<p>" <strong>Death's are quiet natural and its the only  sign of remembrance of a person</strong> "</p>

<p>is the point more stressed and I feel out of this film . Death of Quinnie ,one who made Benjamin a place to stand in this earth when none did .I guess the movie can still be shortened and may prevented the viewers losing their patience. The last moment when Benjamin turns out to baby and when he closes his eyes finally ,  I can  feel entire thrust of the film .</p>

<p>A good time pass rather fixing schedule to watch this film .if you get free time this one is a watchable slow paced film .</p>

<pre><code>                         Steven Spielberg's great movie. Rather animative or more fiction as rest of his movies , this one is a real paced movie about a war. 


          The movie is all about bringing back a man James Ryan from battle field to home , since rest of his brothers have dead in action .A troop of eight under Capt. Miller searches for Ryan . Every character is depicted more keenly and each one's death remembers the moment they lived before in film . Stale one is story of  Ryan's remembrance of his brothers . Mass Death at sea  shore and entry of battalion seems more  wet . 

         Mysteries thing is why German troop man call's Upham( American translator under miller )  by his name before he is shot dead. Reiben's Head shot on German sniper remembers me the same thirst of revenge i felt in subramanipuram . Tasting fruits in middle of charge turns out  the  serious one which's needed to humorous . Same flash back trend can be viewed here. Old aged Hero Private Ryan comes back to his past war memories . 





                      I can speak lot about the captains role. Highly responsible man open to all corporals. His response to all humorous questions from the troop soldiers states , how he value the question even from his lower grade soldier. The word FUBER is  unexplained till end.





                               Im more impressed by the capt. Miller 's role . Exact mirror of a war at ohama beach . capt .Miller's Death makes every one mourn . Feel the real worth of every lives in war and spend a moment for them .
